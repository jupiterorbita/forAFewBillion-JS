/*
There is an old tale about a king who offered a servant $10,000 as a reward. The servant instead asked that for 30 days he be given an amount that would double, starting with a penny. (1 penny for the first day, 2 for the second, 4 for the third, then 8, 16, 32 pennies, and so on).

Use for loops to answer the following:

How much was the reward after 30 days?
remember, a penny isn't 1, but 0.01

Bonus (Only If You Have Time):

How many days would it take the servant to make $10,000?
How about 1 billion?
In JavaScript, there is a value Infinity . How many days until the servant has infinite money?*/
var money = 0.01;
var days;
for (days=1; days<=30; days++){
    money *=2;
    // console.log(days);
}
console.log(`on day ${days} he had made $${money}.`);
// console.log(money);

//How many days would it take the servant to make $10,000?
days = 1;
for (money=0.01; money<=10000; money*=2){
    // console.log("in for loop money is " + money);
    days++
    // console.log("in loop days = "+days);
}
// console.log("after for loop money is " + money);
// console.log("outside loop days = "+days);
console.log("he will have $10,000 in "+days+" days");
